# Team-Project-2-Numerical-Analysis
In this project you and your team members should implement the direct and iterative methods for solving linear systems.

You should code the following methods in Python.

Gauss elimination, including variants with pivoting techniques

Jacobi iterative method

Gauss Seidel iterative method

Successive Over Relaxation

Iterative Refinement

Preconditioned conjugage gradient method.
